# No idea what this project was about

Great example of how **NOT** to make a readme file

Some old project. Probably some camp or programming school class group project

Anyway this is not ideal too, but before i had just this line:

> MVP for our project (best description ever)

Yeah and naming is kinda funny too becase MVP is such a general term...
